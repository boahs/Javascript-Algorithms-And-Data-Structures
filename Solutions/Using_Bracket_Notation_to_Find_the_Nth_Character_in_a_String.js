// Remember when a computer counts it starts at 0 - so the first character is always 0
var firstName = "Boahs";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1]; 
// You can find the second letter in a name using Bracket Notation just like finding the first character. It's that simple.
// Output would be "o" not "B" since the computer starts counting at 0.
